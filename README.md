# Career Advisor Application
Are you a Year 12 student struggling to figure out what you are going to study in tertiary education? No worries! It's a common issue, and this program is designed to help guide you to the right career path.
The aim is to have this program implemented within current Career Advisor programs led by professional career advisors.

Most sessions led by career advisors begin by inputting the same information regarding subjects and your enjoyment of them, which they use to filter down the options to a handful of degrees
We live in a modern, technological society though! Let's streamline this process by using my program! It's easy to use so no training is required.
After this, your career advisor can reject or accept the recommendations provided by the program, where they can then explore career options and university choices in-depth with you!

Alternatively, you can use this program as a standalone. Generate quick degrees tailored to you and do your own research on it!
With just under 2000 degrees in this program's database from over 15 universities across New South Wales, there's a degree for everyone!
